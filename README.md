# ITZY 

This project will be about a kpop band called 'ITZY'. They are currently one of the most popular groups and have the most awards among the 4th gen kpop groups. 

## Design process

My design will be very simple. The first page will show off their current world tour, encouraging people to get tickets to their concert. On the top right of every page, there will be a dropdown which acts as the nav bar and directs the user to the page they want to go. For the second page, there will be information about the group. As for the third, the page will display their latest album and title track, which users can purchase their album and watch their newest music video. On the fourth page, information about their current world tour will be displayed, in which users can buy their merchandise as well as tickets. For the last page, users who would like to get in touch with them for shows can fill in the form to contact them. Links to their social media will also be displayed.
